📌 PROJECT: Static Website Hosting Using Amazon S3
🎯 1. Objective

The objective of this project is to host a fully static website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) using Amazon S3 without using any servers, EC2, or backend infrastructure.
The goal is to build a cost-effective, scalable, and serverless hosting solution that can be accessed globally using the S3 website endpoint.

This shows:
User → S3 Website Endpoint → Public S3 Bucket → Website Content Served.

🛠️ 3. Steps to Host Website on S3
✅ Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket
Go to S3 → Create Bucket
Bucket name: my-static-website
Region: ap-south-1
UNCHECK “Block all public access”
Create bucket

✅ Step 2: Upload Website Files
Upload these files:
index.html
styles.css
script.js

Example:
index.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My S3 Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My S3 Hosted Website!</h1>
    <p>This website runs completely on Amazon S3.</p>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

✅ Step 3: Enable "Static Website Hosting"
Go to Properties → Static Website Hosting
Enable
Index document: index.html
AWS gives a URL like:
http://my-static-website.s3-website-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com

✅ Step 4: Make Objects Public
Go to Permissions → Bucket Policy

Add this policy:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-static-website/*"
    }
  ]
}


Now entire website is publicly accessible.

✅ Step 5: Test the Website
Open browser:
http://my-static-website.s3-website-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com

You will see your live website.

⚙️ 4. Working Explanation (Simple)
The S3 bucket stores static files (HTML, CSS, JS).
Static website hosting converts the bucket into a web hosting server.
Public access policy allows all users to view files.
AWS generates a special website endpoint.
When a user enters that URL → S3 directly serves the HTML page.
No backend, no servers → pure serverless hosting.

❗ 5. Challenges & Solutions
Challenge                    	Why it Happens	                                      Solution
403 Forbidden	              Files are private	                                Add bucket policy & make objects public
CSS/JS not loading	       Only index is public                                Make all objects public
Website not opening        Static hosting disabled	                           Enable "Static Website Hosting"
Wrong URL	                 Using object URL instead of website URL	            Use S3 website endpoint, not object URL
Index file not shown	        Incorrect index name                            	Must be exactly index.html
🚀 6. Result

Website hosted successfully on S3
Accessible publicly anywhere in the world
No EC2, no servers, no maintenance
99.999999999% durability (S3 standard)
Free/very low cost hosting (only storage cost)

🏁 7. Conclusion
Hosting a static website on Amazon S3 is a simple and cost-effective solution for small websites, portfolios, resumes, product pages, and demo projects. It eliminates the need for servers, reduces infrastructure cost, and provides high availability. This project demonstrates how S3 can be used as a serverless web hosting platform with minimal configuration and maximum scalability.
